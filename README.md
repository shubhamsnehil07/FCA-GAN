FCA-GAN: Frequency Cue Attention GAN for Image Colorization
Overview
FCA-GAN is a GAN-based image colorization framework that integrates:
•	Spatial Attention Mechanism
•	Frequency-Domain Cues (FFT-based features)
•	Multi-loss optimization for realistic color synthesis
The model leverages both spatial and frequency information to improve texture consistency and fine detail restoration during colorization.
